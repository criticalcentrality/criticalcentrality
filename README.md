### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Human intelligence has created artificial intelligence and both kind of intelligence are far from perfect. Nonetheless, their synergy has promising opportunities. Our mission is to train people with the soft skills (e.g., patience, persistence, teamwork, or critical thinking) they need to become the next generation of data scientists that our world needs to create a better artificial intelligence. We provide empirical evidence on critical topics to achieve our mission to shape the interdisciplinary mindset of our collaborators, stakeholders, and clients.
