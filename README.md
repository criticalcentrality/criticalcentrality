### Hi there 👋

We're in love 😍 with the potential human intelligence can do by interacting with artificial intelligence. Nonetheless, we know AI is far from perfect, just like humans. Our mission is to train people with the soft skills (e.g., patience, persistence, teamwork, or critical thinking) they need to become the next generation of data scientists that our world needs. We provide empirical evidence on critical topics to achieve our mission to shape the interdisciplinary mindset of our collaborators, stakeholders, and clients.
